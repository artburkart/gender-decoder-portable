# Requirements
Requires Python 3.6+
No external Python dependencies.

# Usage
```command
./run.py joblisting.txt
```

# A note about the intent
I borrowed inspiration for the code from https://github.com/lovedaybrooke/gender-decoder

You should check out their
[README](https://github.com/lovedaybrooke/gender-decoder/blob/master/README.md)

I wanted to be able to run the code from the command-line and the
library referenced in the README above doesn't seem to work with a `pip
install`, so I've made something that works for now, and my intent is to
publish it as a quick and easy library later.
